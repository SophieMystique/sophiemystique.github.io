### Notes
The Full Repertoire is a total of 4 hrs.

Hours Breakdown: 3 sets of continuous singing for 45 min and I5 min break each.

The usual performance starts off with some soft Soul music that smoothly transitions into upbeat R&B and Popular music to keep a lively atmosphere.

And, it needed, I would love to collaborate with you to make small modifications to better adjust to the venue's needs and preferences.
